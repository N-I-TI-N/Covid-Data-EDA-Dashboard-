# A/B Testing For DS Job Recruitment

## Overview

Welcome to the Data Science Role Recruitment Project! This project aims to address challenges in the recruitment process for data science roles by enhancing candidate engagement and understanding the demographic distribution of applicants.

## Problem Statement

As a recruiter for data science roles, I've noticed a significant number of applicants expressing interest but not completing the required screening test. This leads to an incomplete representation of the talent pool and raises concerns about engagement strategies and demographic diversity.

## Solution Approach

The approach to tackle these challenges includes:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct thorough EDA to gain insights into applicant demographics, including gender distribution, age groups, qualification levels, and quiz scores.

2. **Engagement Experiment:** Experiment with sending reminder emails to candidates who haven't completed the quiz. Analyze the impact of proactive communication on the quiz completion ratio.

3. **Interactive Web Application:** Develop an interactive web application showcasing EDA visualizations, allowing experiment execution, displaying results, and providing statistical tests (e.g., chi-square) to assess significance.

## Expected Outcomes

Anticipated outcomes include:

1. **Demographic Insights:** Gain insights into the applicant pool's composition and identify areas for improvement through demographic analysis.

2. **Enhanced Engagement:** Evaluate the impact of reminder emails on the quiz completion rate.

3. **Tailored Recruitment Strategies:** Use demographic insights to tailor recruitment strategies and outreach efforts.

4. **Interactive Reporting:** Present findings, experiments, and statistical tests in an engaging and informative web application.
